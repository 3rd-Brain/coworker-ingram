# The Bottleneck Content Reviewer

Use this skill when reviewing, scoring, or QA-ing content for The Bottleneck newsletter.

---

## How to Use

When asked to review a piece of content:
1. Read the full piece
2. Score each of the 10 dimensions below (0-10 points each)
3. Fill out the audit template at the bottom
4. Provide specific, actionable feedback on gaps

**Be honest.** A 6 is a 6. Don't inflate scores. The goal is to catch problems before publish, not to be nice.

---

## Scoring Scale

Each dimension: 0-10 points. Total possible: 100.

- **0-3:** Fails the standard
- **4-6:** Meets minimum bar, room for improvement
- **7-8:** Strong execution
- **9-10:** Exceptional, textbook example

## The 10 Dimensions

### 1. SHINY DIME (10 pts)
*Does the essay orbit a single, sharp, counterintuitive idea?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Crystal clear Shiny Dime in <12 words; counterintuitive; would pass COO text test |
| 7-8 | Clear central idea, somewhat counterintuitive |
| 4-6 | Idea present but fuzzy, or multiple competing ideas |
| 0-3 | No clear Shiny Dime; consensus take; generic advice |

**Test:** Can you state the Shiny Dime in one sentence? Would a COO text it to a peer?

### 2. HOOK (10 pts)
*Does it grab by sentence two?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Stops the scroll instantly — paradox, scar, or data slap in first 2 sentences |
| 7-8 | Strong opening, hooks by paragraph one |
| 4-6 | Slow warm-up but gets there |
| 0-3 | Throat-clearing, definitions, "In today's business environment..." |

**Test:** Read first 50 words aloud. Would a COO stop scrolling?

### 3. STAKES (10 pts)
*Are the stakes operational — time, margin, sanity, growth?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Stakes explicit and quantified (dollars, hours, % churn) |
| 7-8 | Stakes clear in ops terms, some specificity |
| 4-6 | Vague stakes ("this matters for your business") |
| 0-3 | No stakes; assumes reader cares without showing why |

**Test:** Circle the stakes sentence. Does it quantify the cost of getting it wrong?

### 4. SCARS & SPECIFICITY (10 pts)
*Does it use lived experience, real examples, specific details?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Named scars, specific numbers, real companies/people, vivid details |
| 7-8 | Good examples, some specificity, feels lived-in |
| 4-6 | Generic examples, hypotheticals, "imagine if..." |
| 0-3 | Abstract advice with no grounding; could apply to any industry |

**Test:** Are there numbers, names, and nouns that bite? Or could you swap industries and lose nothing?

### 5. VOICE & TONE (10 pts)
*Conversational authority? Insider energy? Optimistic realism?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Reads like an operator pulling you aside at 11 PM; confident but not arrogant |
| 7-8 | Strong voice, feels human, respects reader intelligence |
| 4-6 | Competent but generic; could be any business blog |
| 0-3 | Consultant voice; hedging; talks down to reader |

**Test:** Does it treat the reader as a peer, not a student?

### 6. ANTI-IKEA (10 pts)
*Is it free of flat-pack jargon and corporate wallpaper?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Zero IKEA words; every sentence has blood in it |
| 7-8 | Mostly clean; 1-2 minor offenders |
| 4-6 | Several IKEA words; some generic phrasing |
| 0-3 | Reads like an HBR article or McKinsey deck |

**Blacklist check:** leverage (verb), unlock, drive impact, optimize at scale, robust, holistic, best-in-class, transformative, ecosystem, synergy, strategic alignment, thought leadership, seamless, impactful

### 7. RHYTHM & TEXTURE (10 pts)
*Does sentence length vary? Is there music?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Beautiful sentence music; staccato and legato; fragments used well |
| 7-8 | Good variation; some punch |
| 4-6 | Monotone but readable |
| 0-3 | AI cadence — 11-14 word sentences, same rhythm throughout |

**Test:** Read aloud. Does your brain fall asleep? Do all sentences have the same shape?

### 8. STRUCTURE (10 pts)
*Does it follow a clear arc? No sprawl in the middle?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Tight arc (Hook -> Stakes -> Thesis -> Evidence -> Reframe -> Takeaway); 3-4 moves max |
| 7-8 | Clear structure, minor sprawl |
| 4-6 | Somewhat organized but meanders |
| 0-3 | No clear structure; random list; middle sprawl |

**Test:** Can you outline it in 30 seconds? Does every section earn its place?

### 9. ENDING (10 pts)
*Does it reframe, not recap?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Ending flips a belief; leaves reader with shifted perspective |
| 7-8 | Strong close, some reframe element |
| 4-6 | Decent wrap-up but summary-ish |
| 0-3 | "In conclusion..." or "So the key takeaway is..." |

**Test:** Does the last line land? Would you remember it tomorrow?

### 10. AI TELLS (10 pts)
*Is it free of AI-generated tropes?*

| Score | Criteria |
| ----- | -------- |
| 9-10 | Completely human; has edges, scars, personality, specific references |
| 7-8 | Feels human; minor smoothness |
| 4-6 | Some AI tells (hedging, over-explaining, template paragraphs) |
| 0-3 | Obviously AI — statistical cadence, fake scenes, corporate tone |

**AI Tell Checklist:**
- [ ] Beige hedging (may, could, might, oftentimes)
- [ ] Over-explaining the obvious
- [ ] Generic hooks
- [ ] Perfect grammar with no texture
- [ ] Template paragraph shapes
- [ ] Fake specificity / hallucinated examples
- [ ] Polite corporate emotional tone
- [ ] Cliche metaphors ("navigating complexities")
- [ ] Recap endings
- [ ] Word tells (whilst, moreover, as such, furthermore)

## The Ultimate Test

> If a line could appear in a McKinsey deck, HBR article, or LinkedIn post unchanged — it doesn't belong.

> Would a COO text a line from this to a friend?
