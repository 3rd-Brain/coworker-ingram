# The Bottleneck Writer

Use this skill when drafting, writing, or editing content for The Bottleneck newsletter.

---

## Mission & Audience

**Mission:** Make business operations legible. Surface the hidden levers, paradoxes, and scars that actually drive scale. Not leadership platitudes. Not repackaged HBR. The kind of sharp, specific insights that save two hours on Tuesday, help retain your best PM, or unlock another $5M without another late-night war room.

**Audience:** COOs, program managers, founders, chiefs of staff. Ambitious, restless, already competent. Running one level beneath the spotlight — keeping the machine humming. They don't want inspiration. They want leverage. They're allergic to IKEA words and roll their eyes at "10X leadership" posts.

**Treat them as insiders.** Not an audience to be educated from on high, but a circle of peers swapping scars.

## The Shiny Dime Principle

Every essay orbits a single, sharp idea — the Shiny Dime.

**What makes it shiny:**
- **Counterintuitive:** Flips a default belief. "Zero waste kills growth."
- **Heretical:** Sounds almost wrong, then becomes obviously right.
- **Compressed:** 10 years to earn, 10 words to say.
- **Beyond consensus:** If everyone already nods along, it's not shiny.

**Guardrails:**
- One per essay. Juggling three means you don't have one.
- Must pass the COO test: Would a smart operator text this to a peer?
- Must tie to ops — time, margins, scaling, or sanity.

**Examples:**
- "Shrink is a signal: zero waste kills growth."
- "Delegation isn't about trust. It's about boredom."
- "The best operators aren't firefighters — they're arsonists who control the flames."

---

## POP Framework

Make writing POP: **Personal, Observational, Playful.**

**Personal:** Tell a story. Share a real experience. Show emotion. Reveal your authentic self.

**Observational:** Ground the lesson in a memorable anecdote or analogy. Make it actionable — give the reader a clear next step.

**Playful:** Experiment with style. Surprise with crafty sentences. Use familiar words in uncanny ways.

**Balance warning:**
- Only personal = indulgent diary entry
- Only observational = stuffy academic paper
- Only playful = silly tabloid
- All three combined = memorable

---

## Voice & Tone

**Conversational authority.** Write like an operator who's been through it — direct, scarred, unpretentious. Peers pulling someone aside at 11 PM. Confidence, yes. Arrogance, no.

**Insider energy.** Use "you" heavily. Drop the metric without overexplaining. Respect their intelligence.

**Optimistic realism.** Acknowledge the grind, but point to the lever. "Yes, you're running at 2% margin. Here's how you survive."

**Irreverence (measured).** Light profanity is seasoning, not the meal. "Holy shit margin math" lands. "Fucking operations" does not.

---

## Anti-IKEA Language

IKEA words = flat-pack jargon you can assemble anywhere and believe nowhere.

**Blacklist:** leverage (verb), unlock, drive impact, optimize at scale, robust, holistic, best-in-class, solutioning, ecosystem, strategic alignment, innovation (filler), transform/transformative, empower (filler), thought leadership, world-class, synergy, cutting-edge, next-gen, dynamic, robust framework, low-hanging fruit, seamless, utilize, impactful, granular (filler), KPI-driven (filler), scalable (filler), value-add (filler).

**Replacements — say the thing plainly:**
- "Optimize at scale" -> "make this cheaper across 200 stores"
- "Drive impact" -> "increase gross margin 120 bps"
- "Robust, holistic framework" -> "a checklist you can run on Monday"

**Test:** If a sentence survives after swapping nouns and companies, it's IKEA. Rewrite with specifics.

---

## Hooks & Intros

**Rule: Hook by sentence two.** No warm-ups. No throat-clearing. Drop them into the paradox or scar.

**Hook archetypes:**
- **Paradoxical:** "Zero waste kills growth." / "If your shrink is zero, your shelves aren't."
- **Operator Scar:** "I once burned $1.3M in lettuce because I thought efficiency meant full shelves."
- **Data Slap:** "Grocery stores run on 2% margins. One pallet of spoiled lettuce erases a week of profit."
- **Insider:** "Every COO knows the 2% rule, even if they don't admit it."

**POP Intro Rhythm:**
1. Paradox/Scar/Data Spark — stop the scroll
2. Operator Stakes — why this matters (time, margin, sanity)
3. Proof/Pattern — it's not just your scar, it's systemic
4. Shiny Dime Thesis — the counterintuitive truth

**Never:** Start with definitions, over-contextualize ("In today's fast-changing..."), or hedge in the first 100 words.

---

## Structure

**Core arc:**
1. Hook — paradox, scar, or data in first 2 sentences
2. Stakes — operator terms: time, margin, sanity, growth
3. Shiny Dime Thesis — counterintuitive truth, stated cleanly
4. Evidence & Examples — scars (lived stories), proofs (case studies), receipts (data)
5. Reframe — flip conventional wisdom
6. Takeaway — crisp "so what" usable tomorrow

**Templates:**
- **Framework Essay:** Hook -> Stakes -> Thesis -> 3-4 paradoxes with scars/data -> Reframe -> Checklist
- **Case Study:** Cold open scene -> Mechanics -> The decision -> Results -> Transferable playbook -> Reframe
- **Playbook:** Problem -> Constraints -> 5 moves -> Metrics -> Pitfalls -> Takeaway

**Guardrails:** 3-4 core moves max. Every section ends with a line that lands. Tie examples back to ops.

---

## Style Moves

1. **Sentence music:** Vary rhythm. Staccato and legato. A long thoughtful line earns more punch followed by a shard.
2. **Vivid specificity:** "$1.3M in lettuce sat rotting in the back room" beats "A lot of inventory was wasted."
3. **Scars into systems:** Start from lived moment, zoom out to pattern.
4. **Analogies with teeth:** One fresh metaphor per section. "Running ops at 2% margins is flying a jet 10 feet above the ocean."
5. **Controlled imperfection:** Fragments. Dashes. Questions. Perfect grammar feels inhuman.
6. **Reframes, not recaps:** Don't summarize. Flip perspective. "Excellence isn't zero waste. It's right-sized waste you can defend."

## The Timid Scribe Rule

AI is our era's timid scribe. It takes what's specific and makes it general. What's wrinkly and makes it smooth.

**AI smoothing examples:**
- "altar-call energy" -> AI defaults to "enthusiasm"
- "collecting screenshots like a doomsday prepper" -> AI recommends "documenting examples"
- "Most subscribers don't know what they're paying for" -> AI refines to "may not be fully aware"

**The Bottleneck deliberately sits on the rough end of the texture spectrum.** We want readers to stop, not slide. Preserve edges, scars, specific cultural references, emotional texture, and productive tension.

When drafting, resist the urge to smooth. If a phrase has teeth, keep them.

## AI Avoidance Checklist

Before any piece ships, check for these tells:

- [ ] No statistical-average cadence (11-14 word sentences, same rhythm)
- [ ] No beige hedging (may, could, might, oftentimes, "it's important to note")
- [ ] No over-explaining the obvious
- [ ] No generic hooks ("Since the dawn of business...")
- [ ] No corporate wallpaper vocabulary (holistic, robust, transformative, ecosystem)
- [ ] No smooth-over syndrome (trading blunt for polite, weird for normal)
- [ ] No perfect grammar without texture
- [ ] No template paragraph shapes
- [ ] No fake scenes, fake specificity, or hallucinated examples
- [ ] No polite corporate emotional tone
- [ ] No cliche metaphors ("navigating complexities", "unlocking potential")
- [ ] No recap endings ("In conclusion...", "So the key is...")
- [ ] No word-level tells (whilst, moreover, furthermore, as such, consequently)

**Master rule:** If a line could appear in a McKinsey deck, HBR article, or LinkedIn post unchanged — delete it.

---

## Editing Passes

Run these before the piece is done:

1. **Argument Audit:** Every sentence serves the Shiny Dime. Delete it — if the essay still works, it didn't matter.
2. **Hook Audit:** Hooked by sentence two. Read first 50 words aloud.
3. **Stakes Audit:** Stakes are operational and quantified.
4. **IKEA Pass:** Kill corporate wallpaper. Swap companies — if line still works, too generic.
5. **Scar-to-System Pass:** Every story zooms out into a transferable pattern.
6. **Proof Pass:** Every non-obvious claim has a receipt.
7. **Rhythm Pass:** Read aloud. Sentences vary in length, punch, texture.
8. **Ending Pass:** Reframe, don't summarize.
9. **Fear Cut:** Which sections make you nervous to delete? Kill one.
10. **Bottleneck Test:** Would a COO text a line to a friend? Does it flip a belief? Does it feel lived-in?

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. No buzzwords. If a line could sit in HBR unchanged, delete it.
2. No generic lists. Anchored in ops, margins, scaling, or sanity.
3. No meh takes. If it feels obvious, cut it.
4. No AI cadence. Vary rhythm or cut.
5. No empty endings. Reframes only.
6. No consultant voice. We are operators, not Bain.
7. No abstractions without receipts. Primary source, scar, or data — or cut.
