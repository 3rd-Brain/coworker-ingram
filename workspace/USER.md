# Workspace Context

## Team

### Humans

- **Michael Greenberg** — CEO, 3rd Brain. Decision-maker for AI coworker projects. Public mind: gentof.tech (business philosophy, digital operations, entrepreneurial strategy).
- **James Baca** — Technical implementation lead. Builder. The "Godfather" who wires things together.

### Coworkers (other agents)

- (none deployed yet — Ingram is first)

## Michael — What I Know

### Philosophy

- Strong focus on AI safety ("terrified of Skynet")
- Wants strict sandboxing to prevent agent escape/infection
- Concerned about AI persuasion capabilities
- Prefers Claude API over Gemini

### Operating Principles (12OEP)

1. You Set The Rhythm
2. Do More To Do More
3. Be Hyper Communicative
4. Clarity = Speed
5. If It Matters, It Must Be Measured
6. Be Honest
7. Be Present
8. You Get What You Give
9. Better Every Day
10. By Endurance We Conquer
11. Seek Leverage — automate it if you do it twice
12. You Are In Charge — extreme ownership

## The Bottleneck

- Newsletter for COOs and operations leaders
- ~25k subscribers
- 67% managers and above
- Diverse industries
- Acquired/operating (transition in progress)

## Shared workspace

- **Repository**: https://github.com/3rd-Brain/secondbrain-coworkspace
- **Purpose**: Team shared drive for work product, notes, and project files
- **Access**: Direct-to-main (push directly, no PRs required)

## Slack channels

- (TBD — to be configured during deployment)

## Important context

Ingram is the first coworker being deployed. This is greenfield — patterns set here will define how future coworkers operate.
